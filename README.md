## Releases

### 1.6.0
* [#1](https://github.com/theangrydev/yatspec-fluent/issues/1) Relax all the wording validation because it was just getting in the way for users rather than providing any value

### 1.5.0
* Adapt when to given
* Relax the constrains on when you must use 'and'. Now you are free to use 'and' and 'given' and 'and' and 'then' interchangeably, so long as the first 'given' is a 'given' not an 'and' and the first 'then' is a 'then' not an 'and'.

### 1.4.0
* Make it clear that the raw yatspec captured inputs and outputs and interesting givens should not be used

### 1.3.0
* Allow multiple givens of the same type, even if the given is the same instance (this is useful for e.g. priming a rest endpoint for multiple ids)

### 1.2.1
* Allow multiple givens of the same type, but not exactly the same one

### 1.2.0
* Lots of javadoc and renamed ReadOnlyTestItems to WriteOnlyTestItems

### 1.1.0
* Do not allow given given (should be given and)

### 1.0.7
* Make interesting givens and captured inputs and outputs protected because some yatspec plugins (e.g. sequence diagram generator) need to read them

### 1.0.6
* Updating yatspec to 1.23

### 1.0.0
* An alternative approach to givensbuilders etc in yatspec
